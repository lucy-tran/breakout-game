# Breakout!

The classic arcade game of Breakout - your goal is to clear a collection of bricks by hitting each of them with a bouncing ball. You have 3 lives at max. After this threshold, you lose if you cannot hit all bricks. Clearing all the bricks at any time during the game gives you a win.

Fun fact: Breakout was developed in 1976 by Steve Wozniak, shortly before he cofounded Apple Computer, Inc. He [cited the experience of building the game](https://archive.org/stream/byte-magazine-1984-12/1984_12_BYTE_09-13_Communications#page/n461/mode/2up) as part of his inspiration in creating Apple, the first commercially viable home computer.
